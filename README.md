# Israel-FPTP-Map
פרוייקט למיפוי שיטת בחירות מחוזית בישראל
A project to map a potential constituency-based electoral system for Israel

Using data from the Central Electoral Commitee, I have divided the State into 199 constituencies, equal in voting-eligible population (within 5% tolerance.
Full data from the 2020 election is included, others will be added in time.

View the map interactively at https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/israel-199-constituencies-project_508720 .

The tool colourer.py allows users to colour the map according to data found in the attached table, producing maps ready to be rendered.
Example maps may be found in the folder "rendered".
This code is intended for use with the premade map only.
